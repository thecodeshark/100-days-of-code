# The IRIS Dataset

The iris data set is a basic dataset used to introduce learners to machine learning. It is a 4 feature, 3 class problem. The data set can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) or it can be loaded directly from the sklearn module in python as I have done. Three models have been applied to the data set:
* [Logistic Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression)
* [Decision Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree)
* [K Nearest Neighbours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)
